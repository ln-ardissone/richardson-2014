# DIPP Turku Analysis

After cloning this repo, download the data:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

(after installing necessary libraries and what-not)

`make`

## Instructions for generating figures

All figures require an RData file which contains the OTU abundance data as well
as sample metadata. This file is created using the script `bin/write-rdata`. To
generate the RData used in this work, run the command `make dipp-rf-uniq.RData`
from the `R/` directory.

### Figure 1 - LOESS regression of significant OTUs

`make glms`

### Figure 2 - Sliding window

`make sliding_window`

### Figure 3 - Phylogenetic tree

This I had to do manually

### Figure 4 - Prediction figure

`make autoimmunity-timing.pdf`
